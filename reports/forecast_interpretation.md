# Forecast Interpretation: Ethiopia 2025-2027
**Analyst:** Rufta

## Executive Summary
Our model predicts a significant acceleration in **Account Ownership (Access)**, reaching a baseline of **60.6% by end-of-2026** and **64.3% by end-of-2027**. This represents a faster growth rate than the 2021-2024 period, driven by the cumulative impact of mobile money competition and digital ID rollout.

## Key Model Drivers
1. **The "Fayda" Catalyst:** The National ID rollout is the strongest driver in the **Optimistic Scenario**, potentially pushing Access to **66.2%** by 2027 by solving the KYC bottleneck for the unbanked.
2. **Mobile Money Maturation:** The entry of M-Pesa alongside Telebirr has shifted the baseline trend upward. The model suggests that the market is moving from "early adoption" to "mass market" status.
3. **Infrastructure Ceiling:** The **Pessimistic Scenario** (62.3% by 2027) accounts for potential stagnation if smartphone affordability and rural 4G coverage do not keep pace with fintech product launches.

## Uncertainty Acknowledgment
- **Data Sparsity:** With limited historical Findex points, the model is sensitive to the 2024 data jump. 
- **Model Confidence:** We used a 95% confidence interval; however, the "black swan" risk of macroeconomic shifts (e.g., currency fluctuations affecting device prices) remains an unmodeled variable.
